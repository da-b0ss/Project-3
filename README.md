Features: Our program, FoodSearch, will provide users with easy access to a variety of
recommended foods based on their desired nutritional content. Users should be able to search
for foods based on a range of criteria, including protein, carbohydrates, fat, and more. The foods
highest in such desired nutrients would then be displayed first.

Data: We will use the United States Department of Agriculture’s Food Composition Database,
sourced from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 2019/20 data . This dataset contains detailed
information about the nutritional content of a wide range of foods, including macronutrients,
micronutrients, and other relevant information.

Strategy: We will implement a singly-linked list to store the data for the nutrition content of food,
then compare a merge-sort algorithm to a shell sort algorithm to find foods high in specific
nutrient content that the user selected, for example, the user selects vitamin A from a dropdown
menu and then can choose between using a merge-sort or shell sort algorithm to find foods that
are highest in vitamin A.
